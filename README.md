# Ping Identity Docker Builds

## Overview
Sample docker builds for the Ping Identity product line.  Many of the public images found at
http://hub.docker.com/r/pingidentity are automatically built based on these images.  These
builds are intended to provide example references starting points to be enhanced for specific
use cases.  They are not intended to be used for production deployments.

## Disclaimer
These example docker builds are open sourced by Ping Identity but not supported commercially as such. 
Any questions/issues should go to the Github issues tracker. See also the DISCLAIMER file in this directory.
